# MontiLang

# About
Monti is a stack-based language revolving around imperative commands to manipulate the stack. The syntax of the language is quite similar to the [FORTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)) programming language in it's syntax.

# Current State
Some of the features that are currently implemented are as follows:

* Integer, float and string data types
* Common operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `%`, `/`, etc.)
* Multi line comments
